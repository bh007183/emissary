  ## Description

  My third and best attempt at building a chat application. This is a normal chat application where you can send, receive, edit, and delete messages. You can send and recieve friend requests as well. When you first create an account and loggin, you are greated with a short intro as to what certain buttons do. You can also recieve notifications when your friend requests are accepted.
